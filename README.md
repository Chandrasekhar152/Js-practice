This repository was created by pushing local workspace files from a user's machine.

Contents
- `cart.html` — simple demo HTML present in the workspace.

How to use
1. Open `cart.html` in your browser.
2. Edit files locally and push changes to GitHub:

```powershell
Set-Location -LiteralPath 'C:\Users\saran\Desktop\Js Learning'
git add -A
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push

If you want, open an issue or request features and I'll help implement them.
